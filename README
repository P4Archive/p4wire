# P4 Wire Example Application #

The P4 Wire application is a basic example application. There is 2 variants of this project:
1. port_to_vf - Forwards traffic from vf_0_0 to p0 and vice versa. Please note this project requires hardware SR-IOV support.
2. port_to_port - Forwards traffic from p0 to p4 and vice versa.

# Installing and Testing P4 Wire with ICONICS:

1.  Follow instructions on http://iconicsp4.cloudapp.net/ to install the NFP SDK RTE, setup access to the ICONICS repository and identifying your SmartNIC

    To install port_to_vf package:
      yum install nfp-sdk6-p4-config-<smartnic>-p4wire-<version>.noarch
	To install port_to_port package:
	  yum install nfp-sdk6-p4-config-<smartnic>-p4wire_port_to_port-<version>.noarch
	  
	List all the available packages in the repo:
	  repoquery -qa --repoid=iconics

2.  The test script will be installed to:
      /opt/nfp_pif/etc/smartnic-configs/<smartnic>-p4wire/
		or
	  /opt/nfp_pif/etc/smartnic-configs/<smartnic>-p4wire_port_to_port/
	  
3.  Wait (around 2 minutes) for firmware to load onto the SmartNIC:
      Use ifconfig to see when VFs have loaded before trying to run tests or look in /var/log/nfp-sdk6-rte.log

4.  Run the test script 
	For vf_to_port on the host where your SmartNIC and traditional NIC is installed:
      ./p4wire-test.sh <port> 
	  Example for the port_to_vf1 setup below:
      ./p4wire-test.sh p2p1
	  
	For port_to_port on the host where your traditional NIC is installed:
      ./p4wire-test.sh <port1> <port2> 
	  Example for the port_to_port setup below:
      ./p4wire-test.sh p2p1 p2p2

      Make sure you have downloaded the .pcap files provided in this repo
      Make sure you have tcpreplay installed on your host:
        yum install tcpreplay
      The .pcap files must be in the same directory as the test script.

5.  Setup for port_to_vf:
                      Host

  The test script will do the following:
    - Send a packet from <port> to p0: Forward to vf0_0
    - Send a packet to vf0_0: Forward to p0
