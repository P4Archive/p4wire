Environment Setup for ICONICS Example P4 Apps:

Download and install RTE ............


Testing the P4 Wire:

1.  Install the p4wire rpm package for your specific SmartNIC:
      http://iconicsp4.cloudapp.net/repo/p4wire/

      To add repository:
        Add the following to /etc/yum.conf at the end of the file:
        [base-p4apps]
        name=P4 apps
        failovermethod=priority
        baseurl=http://iconicsp4.cloudapp.net/repo/
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=0

      All the available packages can be listed with:
        repoquery -a --repoid=base-p4apps

      To install:
        yum install nfp-sdk6-p4-config-<smartnic>-p4wire-1.00-1.noarch

2.  The test script will be installed to:
      /opt/nfp_pif/etc/smartnic-configs/<smartnic>-p4wire/

3.  Wait for firmware to load onto the SmartNIC:
      Use ifconfig to see when VFs have loaded before trying to run tests.

4.  Run the test script on the host where your SmartNIC is installed:
      ./p4wire-test.sh <port>
      ./p4wire-test.sh p2p1

      Make sure you have downloaded the .pcap files provided in this repo
      Make sure you have tcpreplay installed on your host:
        yum install tcpreplay
      The .pcap files must be in the same directory as the test script.

5.  Setup:
                      Host
